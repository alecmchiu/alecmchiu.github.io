I've divided this light introduction into three parts: _programming_, _bioinformatics_, and _advanced classes_. Some of these classes can be done in parallel and I will provide a flow chart that helps display how these courses can be taken in parallel. That being said, foundations in programming should be established first, so those will have to be done in sequence. All courses here are hosted for free on Coursera.

If you are on a Windows machine, you will need some sort of command line emulator such as PuTTY or Cygwin. On a Mac, your command line interface, Terminal, is built into the operating system. Additionally, you should download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io) of *Python 2.7*. This distribution comes pre-installed with many useful Python modules.

**Programming**

*Python*

- [Codeacademy Python Track](https://www.codecademy.com/). This is a self-paced track that is a great way to get started.
- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) on Coursera hosted by Rice University. The first two courses of this class should be enough before you move on to bioinformatics courses. This course sequence is thorough enough that it should at least introduce you to most of the concepts you'll encounter in bioinformatics.

*R*

- [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools) followed by [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). The Data Scientist's Toolbox is a simple course that introduces you to R and GitHub. GitHub is used for online peer-graded assignments in the more compreehensive R programming course.

*Bash*

- [Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools) from the Genomic Data Science Specialization on Coursera hosted by JHU. This will introduce you to UNIX systems and the Bash language. In addition, you will be introduced on how to use common tools in bioinformatics.
- [Ryan's Linux Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/). This is a short tutorial on how to navigate a command line interface.
- [Ryan's Bash Scripting Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/). This is a more in-depth tutorial on how to use Bash scripts. It is a good continuation from the Linux tutorial.


**Bioinformatics**

- [Bioinformatic Methods I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-methods-1) and [Bioinformatic Methods II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-methods-2). These courses introduce you to the most common uses for bioinformatics and the tools used to perform them.
- [Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics). This course is a soft introduction to the more advanced bioinformatics classes hosted by UCSD. You will need to have a basic understanding of Python for these courses.
- [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) on Coursera hosted by JHU. This specialization provides you with a good overview of the field of bioinformatics, but it is much less comprehensive than other courses out there.

**Advanced Classes**

- [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computational-biology) on Coursera hosted by UCSD. This is a very comprehensive course sequence on bioinformatics. Many professors use similar curriculums to this course sequence. It requires a strong understanding of a programming language (Python is probably best).
